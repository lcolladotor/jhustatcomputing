### Submitting Quarto documents to CoursePlus

Some of you might choose to use Quarto for making your HTML project files instead of Rmarkdown. If so, keep in mind that Quarto will create a directory that has to be shared along with the HTML file ^[RMarkdown generates self-contained HTML files whereas Quarto does not.]. That is, you will have to make a ZIP file that contains both the (A) HTML file made with Quarto, and (B) the *_quarto_files directory that Quarto also made. Then upload the ZIP file to CoursePlus.

Taking https://github.com/lcolladotor/StatComputing_ProjectDemo as an example, the ZIP file would have to contain:

* The HTML file <https://github.com/lcolladotor/StatComputing_ProjectDemo/blob/gh-pages/2025-09-02_demo_quarto.html>
* The `"*_quarto_files"` directory <https://github.com/lcolladotor/StatComputing_ProjectDemo/tree/gh-pages/2025-09-02_demo_quarto_files>


If needed, you can download your own project submission from CoursePlus to verify that it looks as you intended. To do so, I recommend downloading your submission to your `~/Desktop` or `~/Downloads` directory (one that is separate from where you did the initial work). Then open the HTML file on your browser to verify that it does indeed look as you intended.
