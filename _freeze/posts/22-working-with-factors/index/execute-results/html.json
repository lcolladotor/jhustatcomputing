What if the **original data source** for where the categorical data is getting ingested **changes**?\n    -   If a domain expert is providing spreadsheet data at regular intervals, code that worked on the initial data may not generate an error message, but could silently produce incorrect results.\n2.  What if a **new level** of a categorical data is added in an updated dataset?\n3.  When categorical data are coded with numerical values, it can be easy to **break the relationship between category numbers and category labels** without realizing it, thus losing the information encoded in a variable.\n    -   Let's consider an example of this below.\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Example\n\nConsider a set of decades,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nx1_original <- c(10, 10, 10, 50, 60, 20, 20, 40)\nx1_factor <- factor(x1_original)\nattributes(x1_factor)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n$levels\n[1] \"10\" \"20\" \"40\" \"50\" \"60\"\n\n$class\n[1] \"factor\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntibble(x1_original, x1_factor) %>%\n    mutate(x1_numeric = as.numeric(x1_factor))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n  x1_original x1_factor x1_numeric\n        <dbl> <fct>          <dbl>\n1          10 10                 1\n2          10 10                 1\n3          10 10                 1\n4          50 50                 4\n5          60 60                 5\n6          20 20                 2\n7          20 20                 2\n8          40 40                 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nInstead of creating a new variable with a numeric version of the value of the factor variable `x1_factor`, the **variable loses the original numerical categories** and **creates a factor number** (i.e., 10 is mapped to 1, 20 is mapped to 2, and 40 is mapped to 3, etc).\n:::\n\nThis **result is unexpected** because `base::as.numeric()` is intended to recover numeric information by coercing a character variable.\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Example\n\nCompare the following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nas.numeric(c(\"hello\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: NAs introduced by coercion\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] NA\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nas.numeric(factor(c(\"hello\")))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the first example, R does not how to convert the character string to a numeric, so it returns a `NA`.\n\nIn the second example, it creates factor numbers and orders them according to an alphabetical order. Here is another example of this behavior:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nas.numeric(factor(c(\"hello\", \"goodbye\")))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nThis behavior of the `factor()` function feels unexpected at best.\n\nAnother example of **unexpected behavior** is how the function will **silently make a missing value** because the values in the data and the levels do not match.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfactor(\"a\", levels = \"c\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] <NA>\nLevels: c\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe **unfortunate behavior of factors in R** has led to an online movement against the default behavior of many data import functions to make factors out of any variable composed as strings.\n\nThe tidyverse is part of this movement, with functions from the `readr` package defaulting to leaving strings as-is. Others used to chose to add `options(stringAsFactors = FALSE)` into their start up commands to override R's default of `stringsAsFactors = TRUE` in functions such as `read.table()`. However, that is no longer needed in recent versions of R as the default has become `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` as documented on the official R blog: <https://blog.r-project.org/2020/02/16/stringsasfactors/>.\n\n## Factors when modeling data\n\nSo if factors are so troublesome, what's the point of them in the first place?\n\nFactors are **still necessary for some data analytic tasks**. The most salient case is in **statistical modeling**.\n\nWhen you pass a factor variable into `lm()` or `glm()`, R automatically creates indicator (or more colloquially 'dummy') variables for each of the levels and picks one as a reference group.\n\nFor simple cases, this behavior can also be **achieved with a character vector**.\n\nHowever, to choose **which level to use as a reference level** or to order classes, factors must be used.\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Example\n\nConsider a vector of character strings with three income levels:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nincome_level <- c(\n    rep(\"low\", 10),\n    rep(\"medium\", 10),\n    rep(\"high\", 10)\n)\nincome_level\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] \"low\"    \"low\"    \"low\"    \"low\"    \"low\"    \"low\"    \"low\"    \"low\"   \n [9] \"low\"    \"low\"    \"medium\" \"medium\" \"medium\" \"medium\" \"medium\" \"medium\"\n[17] \"medium\" \"medium\" \"medium\" \"medium\" \"high\"   \"high\"   \"high\"   \"high\"  \n[25] \"high\"   \"high\"   \"high\"   \"high\"   \"high\"   \"high\"  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere, it **might make sense to use the lowest income level (low) as the reference** class so that all the other coefficients can be interpreted in comparison to it.\n\nHowever, R would use **high as the reference** by default because 'h' comes before 'l' in the alphabet.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- factor(income_level)\nx\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] low    low    low    low    low    low    low    low    low    low   \n[11] medium medium medium medium medium medium medium medium medium medium\n[21] high   high   high   high   high   high   high   high   high   high  \nLevels: high low medium\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny <- rnorm(30) #

factor** that needs to be mentioned briefly: ordered factors.\n\n**Ordered factors**, created with `ordered()`, imply a strict ordering and equal distance between levels:\n\nThe **first level** is \"less than\" the **second level** by the same amount that the second level is \"less than\" the **third level**, and so on...\n\nYou can recognize them when printing because they use `<` between the factor levels:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nordered(c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] a b c\nLevels: a < b < c\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHowever, in practice, `ordered()` factors **behave very similarly to regular factors**.\n\n# Post-lecture materials\n\n### Final Questions\n\nHere are some post-lecture questions to help you think about the material discussed.\n\n::: callout-note\n### Questions\n\n1.  Explore the distribution of `rincome` (reported income). What makes the default bar chart hard to understand? How could you improve the plot?\n\n2.  What is the most common `relig` in this survey? What's the most common `partyid`?\n\n3.  Which `relig` does `denom` (denomination) apply to? How can you find out with a table? How can you find out with a visualization?\n\n4.  There are some suspiciously high numbers in `tvhours`. Is the mean a good summary?\n\n5.  For each factor in `gss_cat` identify whether the order of the levels is arbitrary or principled.\n\n6.  Why did moving \"Not applicable\" to the front of the levels move it to the bottom of the plot?\n\n7.  How have the proportions of people identifying as Democrat, Republican, and Independent changed over time?\n\n8.  How could you collapse `rincome` into a small set of categories?\n\n9.  Notice there are 9 groups (excluding other) in the `fct_lump` example above. Why not 10?
