Plot the data\n2.  Overlay a summary\n3.  Add metadata and annotation\n:::\n\nFor quick exploratory plots you may not get past step 1.\n\n## Example: BMI, PM2.5, Asthma\n\nTo demonstrate the various pieces of `ggplot2` we will use a running example from the **Mouse Allergen and Asthma Cohort Study (MAACS)**. Here, the question we are interested in is\n\n> \"Are overweight individuals, as measured by body mass index (BMI), more susceptible than normal weight individuals to the harmful effects of PM2.5 on asthma symptoms?\"\n\nThere is a suggestion that overweight individuals may be more susceptible to the negative effects of inhaling PM2.5.\n\nThis would suggest that increases in PM2.5 exposure in the home of an overweight child would be more deleterious to his/her asthma symptoms than they would be in the home of a normal weight child.\n\nWe want to see if we can see that difference in the data from MAACS.\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Note\n\nBecause the individual-level data for this study are protected by various U.S. privacy laws, we cannot make those data available.\n\nFor the purposes of this lesson, we have **simulated data** that share many of the same features of the original data, but do not contain any of the actual measurements or values contained in the original dataset.\n:::\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Example\n\nWe can look at the data quickly by reading it in as a tibble with `read_csv()` in the `tidyverse` package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nmaacs <- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"bmi_pm25_no2_sim.csv\"),\n                  col_types = \"nnci\")\nmaacs\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 517 × 4\n   logpm25 logno2_new bmicat        NocturnalSympt\n     <dbl>      <dbl> <chr>                  <int>\n 1   1.25       1.18  normal weight              1\n 2   1.12       1.55  overweight                 0\n 3   1.93       1.43  normal weight              0\n 4   1.37       1.77  overweight                 2\n 5   0.775      0.765 normal weight              0\n 6   1.49       1.11  normal weight              0\n 7   2.16       1.43  normal weight              0\n 8   1.65       1.40  normal weight              0\n 9   1.55       1.81  normal weight              0\n10   2.04       1.35  overweight                 3\n# ℹ 507 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nThe outcome we will look at here (`NocturnalSymp`) is the number of days in the past 2 weeks where the child experienced asthma symptoms (e.g. coughing, wheezing) while sleeping.\n\nThe other key variables are:\n\n-   `logpm25`: average level of PM2.5 over the course of 7 days (micrograms per cubic meter) on the log scale\n\n-   `logno2_new`: exhaled nitric oxide on the log scale\n\n-   `bmicat`: categorical variable with BMI status\n\n# Building up in layers\n\nFirst, we can **create a `ggplot` object** that stores the dataset and the basic aesthetics for mapping the x- and y-coordinates for the plot.\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Example\n\nHere, we will eventually be plotting the log of PM2.5 and `NocturnalSymp` variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ng <- ggplot(maacs, aes(x = logpm25, \n                       y = NocturnalSympt))\nsummary(g)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\ndata: logpm25, logno2_new, bmicat, NocturnalSympt [517x4]\nmapping:  x = ~logpm25, y = ~NocturnalSympt\nfaceting: <ggproto object: Class FacetNull, Facet, gg>\n    compute_layout: function\n    draw_back: function\n    draw_front: function\n    draw_labels: function\n    draw_panels: function\n    finish_data: function\n    init_scales: function\n    map_data: function\n    params: list\n    setup_data: function\n    setup_params: function\n    shrink: TRUE\n    train_scales: function\n    vars: function\n    super:  <ggproto object: Class FacetNull, Facet, gg>\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass(g)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"gg\"     \"ggplot\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nYou can see above that the object `g` contains the dataset `maacs` and the mappings.\n\nNow, normally if you were to `print()` a `ggplot` object a plot would appear on the plot device, however, our object `g` actually does not contain enough information to make a plot yet.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ng <- maacs %>%\n        ggplot(aes(logpm25, NocturnalSympt))\nprint(g)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Nothing to see here!](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## First plot with point layer\n\nTo make a scatter plot, we need add at least one **geom**, such as points.\n\nHere, we add the `geom_point()` function to create a traditional scatter plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ng <- maacs %>%\n        ggplot(aes(logpm25, NocturnalSympt))\ng + geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot of PM2.5 and days with nocturnal symptoms](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHow does ggplot know what points to plot?

We can use the `cut()` function for this purpose. We will divide the NO2 variable into tertiles.\n\nFirst we need to calculate the tertiles with the `quantile()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncutpoints <- quantile(maacs$logno2_new, seq(0, 1, length = 4), na.rm = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen we need to divide the original `logno2_new` variable into the ranges defined by the cut points computed above.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmaacs$no2tert <- cut(maacs$logno2_new, cutpoints)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `not2tert` variable is now a categorical factor variable containing 3 levels, indicating the ranges of NO2 (on the log scale).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## See the levels of the newly created factor variable\nlevels(maacs$no2tert)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"(0.342,1.23]\" \"(1.23,1.47]\"  \"(1.47,2.17]\" \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe final plot shows the relationship between PM2.5 and nocturnal symptoms by BMI category and NO2 tertile.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Setup ggplot with data frame\ng <- maacs %>%\n        ggplot(aes(logpm25, NocturnalSympt))\n\n## Add layers\ng + geom_point(alpha = 1/3) + \n        facet_grid(bmicat ~ no2tert) + \n        geom_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE, col=\"steelblue\") + \n        theme_bw(base_family = \"Avenir\", base_size = 10) + \n        labs(x = expression(\"log \" * PM[2.5])) + \n        labs(y = \"Nocturnal Symptoms\") + \n        labs(title = \"MAACS Cohort\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![PM2.5 and nocturnal symptoms by BMI category and NO2 tertile](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png){width=864}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</details>\n\n### Final Questions\n\nHere are some post-lecture questions to help you think about the material discussed.\n\n::: callout-note\n### Questions\n\n1.  What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?\n\n2.  Read `?facet_wrap`. What does `nrow` do? What does `ncol` do? What other options control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesn't `facet_grid()` have `nrow` and `ncol` arguments?\n\n3.  What geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? A histogram? An area chart?\n\n4.  What does `geom_col()` do? How is it different to `geom_bar()`?\n:::\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n::: callout-tip\n-   <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation>\n-   <https://rdpeng.github.io/Biostat776/lecture-the-ggplot2-plotting-system-part-2>\n:::\n\n# R session information\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noptions(width = 120)\nsessioninfo::session_info()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n─ Session info ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n setting  value\n version  R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)\n os       macOS Ventura 13.5\n system   aarch64, darwin20\n ui       X11\n language (EN)\n collate  en_US.UTF-8\n ctype    en_US.UTF-8\n tz       America/New_York\n date     2023-08-17\n pandoc   3.1.5 @ /opt/homebrew/bin/ (via rmarkdown)\n\n─ Packages ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n package        * version date (UTC) lib source\n bit              4.0.5   2022-11-15 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n bit64            4.0.5   2020-08-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n cli              3.6.1   2023-03-23 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n colorout         1.2-2   2023-05-06 [1] Github (jalvesaq/colorout@79931fd)\n colorspace       2.1-0   2023-01-23 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n crayon           1.5.2   2022-09-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n digest           0.6.33  2023-07-07 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n dplyr          * 1.1.2   2023-04-20 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n evaluate         0.21    2023-05-05 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n fansi            1.0.4   2023-01-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n farver           2.1.1   2022-07-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n fastmap          1.1.1   2023-02-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n forcats        * 1.0.0   2023-01-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n generics         0.1.3   2022-07-05 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n ggplot2        * 3.4.3   2023-08-14 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.1)\n glue             1.6.2   2022-02-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n gtable           0.3.3   2023-03-21 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n here           * 1.0.1   2020-12-13 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n hms              1.1.3   2023-03-21 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n htmltools        0.5.6   2023-08-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n htmlwidgets      1.6.2   2023-03-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n jsonlite         1.8.7   2023-06-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n knitr            1.43    2023-05-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n labeling         0.4.2   2020-10-20 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n lattice          0.21-8  2023-04-05 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.1)\n lifecycle        1.0.3   2022-10-07 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n lubridate      * 1.9.2   2023-02-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n magrittr         2.0.3   2022-03-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n Matrix           1.6-1   2023-08-14 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n mgcv             1.9-0   2023-07-11 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n munsell          0.5.0   2018-06-12 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n nlme             3.1-163 2023-08-09 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n palmerpenguins * 0.1.1   2022-08-15 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n pillar           1.9.0   2023-03-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n pkgconfig        2.0.3   2019-09-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n purrr          * 1.0.2   2023-08-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n R6               2.5.1   2021-08-19 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n readr          * 2.1.4   2023-02-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n rlang            1.1.1   2023-04-28 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n rmarkdown        2.24    2023-08-14 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.1)\n rprojroot        2.0.3   2022-04-02 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n rstudioapi       0.15.0  2023-07-07 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n scales           1.2.1   2022-08-20 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n sessioninfo      1.2.2   2021-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n stringi          1.7.12  2023-01-11 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n stringr        * 1.5.0   2022-12-02 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n tibble         * 3.2.1   2023-03-20 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n tidyr          * 1.3.0   2023-01-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n tidyselect       1.2.0   2022-10-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n tidyverse      * 2.0.0   2023-02-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n timechange       0.2.0   2023-01-11 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n tzdb             0.4.0   2023-05-12 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n utf8             1.2.3   2023-01-31 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n vctrs            0.6.3   2023-06-14 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n vroom            1.6.3   2023-04-28 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n withr            2.5.0   2022-03-03 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n xfun             0.40    2023-08-09 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n yaml             2.3.7   2023-01-23 [1] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n\n [1] /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/library\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
