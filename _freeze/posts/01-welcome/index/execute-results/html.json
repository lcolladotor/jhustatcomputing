Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/) designed and maintained in 2021 and 2022. Check the recent changes to this file through the [GitHub history](https://github.com/lcolladotor/jhustatcomputing/commits/main/posts/01-welcome/index.qmd).*\n\nWelcome! I am very excited to have you in our one-term (i.e. half a semester) course on Statistical Computing course number (140.776) offered by the [Department of Biostatistics](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics) at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu). This will be my first time as the lead instructor of a JHBSPH course! üôåüèΩ\n\nThis course is designed for ScM and PhD students at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. I am pretty flexible about permitting outside students, but I want everyone to be aware of the goals and assumptions so no one feels like they are surprised by how the class works.\n\n::: callout-note\nThe primary goal of the course is to teach you practical programming and computational skills required for the research and application of statistical methods.\n:::\n\nThis class is not designed to teach the theoretical aspects of statistical or computational methods, but rather the goal is to help with the **practical issues** related to setting up a statistical computing environment for data analyses, developing high-quality R packages, conducting reproducible data analyses, best practices for data visualization and writing code, and creating websites for personal or project use.\n\n### Assumptions and pre-requisites\n\nThe course is designed for students in the Johns Hopkins Biostatistics Masters and PhD programs. However, we do not assume a significant background in statistics. Specifically we assume:\n\n#### 1. You know the **basics** of at least one programming language (e.g. R or Python)\n\n-   If it's not R, we assume that you are willing to spend the time to learn R\n-   You have heard of things such as control structures, functions, loops, etc\n-   Know the difference between different data types (e.g. character, numeric, etc)\n-   Know the basics of plotting (e.g. what is a scatterplot, histogram, etc)\n\n#### 2. You know the **basics** of computing environments\n\n-   You have access to a computing environment (i.e. locally on a laptop or working in the cloud)\n-   You generally feel comfortable with installing and working with software\n\n#### 3. You know the **basics** of statistics\n\n-   The central dogma (estimates, standard errors, basic distributions, etc.)\n-   Key statistical terms and methods\n-   Differences between estimation vs testing vs prediction\n-   Know how to fit and interpret **basic** statistical models (e.g. linear models)\n\n#### 4. You know the **basics** of reproducible research\n\n-   Difference between replication and reproducible. If not, check this excellent paper by Prasad Patil et al.: <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-019-0629-z>.\n-   Know how to cite references (e.g. like in a publication)\n-   Somewhat familiar with tools that enable reproducible research (In complete transparency, we will briefly cover these topics in the first week, but depending on your comfort level with them, this may impact whether you choose to continue with the course).\n\nSince the target audience for this course is advanced students in statistics we will not be able to spend significant time covering these concepts and technologies. To give you some idea about how these prerequisites will impact your experience in the course, we will be using R for nearly all classes, we will be turning in all assignments via R Markdown documents and you will be encouraged (not required) to use git/GitHub to track changes to your code over time. The majority of the assignments will involve learning the practical issues around performing data analyses, building software packages, building websites, etc all using the R programming language. Data analyses you will perform will also often involve significant data extraction, cleaning, and transformation. We will learn about tools to do all of this, but hopefully most of this sounds familiar to you so you can focus on the concepts we will be teaching around best practices for statistical computing.\n\n::: callout-tip\nSome resources that may be useful if you feel you may be missing pieces of this background:\n\n-   **Statistics** - [Mathematical Biostatistics Bootcamp I (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/biostatistics); [Mathematical Biostatistics Bootcamp II (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/biostatistics-2)\n-   **Basic Data Science** - [Cloud Data Science (Leanpub)](https://leanpub.com/universities/set/jhu/cloud-based-data-science); [Data Science Specialization (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)\n-   **Version Control** - [Github Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/); [Happy Git and Github for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/)\n-   **Rmarkdown** - [Rmarkdown introduction](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)\n-   **R 101** [*LIBD rstats club*](https://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/) blog post: <https://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/2018/12/24/r_101/>\n-   **Introductory R videos** from the [*LIBD rstats club*](https://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/) such as these videos:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/T51DRWeuKm8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen>\n\n</iframe>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XTuJ8vGnzBU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen>\n\n</iframe>\n:::\n\n### Getting set up\n\nYou must install [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) on your computing environment in order to complete this course.\n\nThese are two **different** applications that must be installed separately before they can be used together:\n\n-   `R` is the core underlying programming language and computing engine that we will be learning in this course\n\n-   `RStudio` is an interface into R that makes many aspects of using and programming R simpler\n\nBoth `R` and `RStudio` are available for Windows, macOS, and most flavors of Unix and Linux. Please download the version that is suitable for your computing setup.\n\nThroughout the course, we will make use of numerous R add-on packages that must be installed over the Internet. Packages can be installed using the `install.packages()` function in R. For example, to install the `tidyverse` package, you can run\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nin the R console.\n\n#### How to Download R for Windows\n\nGo to [https://cran.r-project.org]() and\n\n1.

Install and configure software necessary for a statistical programming environment\n2.  Discuss generic programming language concepts as they are implemented in a high-level statistical language\n3.  Write and debug code in base R and the tidyverse (and integrate code from Python modules)\n4.  Build basic data visualizations using R and the tidyverse\n5.  Discuss best practices for coding and reproducible research, basics of data ethics, basics of working with special data types, and basics of storing data\n\n# Course logistics\n\nThe only option is to take the course is in-person (140.776.01).\n\n-   <https://lcolladotor.github.io/jhustatcomputing>\n\nAll communication for the course is going to take place on one of three platforms:\n\n-   **Courseplus**: for discussion, sharing resources, collaborating, and announcements\n\n-   **Github**: for getting access to course materials (e.g. lectures, project assignments)\n\n    -   Course Github: <https://github.com/lcolladotor/jhustatcomputing>\n\n-   **Lectures**: lectures will be in person\n\n    -   All in person lectures to be recorded and posted online after class ends\n    -   If for some reason I am sick or not capable of coming onsite, I will send out a Zoom link for everyone to attend remotely for that day.\n\nThe primary communication for the class will go through Courseplus. That is where we will post course announcements, answer common questions, and as the primary means of communication between course participants and course instructors.\n\n::: callout-important\nIf you are registered for the course, you should have access to Courseplus now. Once you have access you will also be able to find all material and dates/times of drop-in hours. Any Zoom links will be posted on Courseplus.\n:::\n\n### Course Staff\n\nThe course instructor this year is [Leonardo Collado Torres](http://lcolladotor.github.io/) who is an Investigator at the [Lieber Institute for Brain Development](https://www.libd.org/) and an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics) at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu). I was actually a student of this course in Fall 2012 when [Roger D. Peng](https://twitter.com/rdpeng) was the instructor of this course and [Jenna Krall](https://twitter.com/kralljr) was the only teaching assistant. I first taught this course in 2023. I myself started learning and [teaching](http://lcolladotor.github.io/#teaching) about R in 2008 and we have a lot of material in the [LIBD rstats club](https://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/) that you might be interested in.\n\nAt the Lieber Institute for Brain Development ([LIBD](https://www.libd.org/)), my group works on understanding the roots and signatures of disease (particularly psychiatric disorders) by zooming in across dimensions of gene activity. We achieve this by studying gene expression at all expression feature levels (genes, exons, exon-exon junctions, and un-annotated regions) and by using different gene expression measurement technologies (bulk RNA-seq, single cell/nucleus RNA-seq, and spatial transcriptomics) that provide finer biological resolution and localization of gene expression. We work closely with collaborators from LIBD as well as from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and other institutions, which reflects the cross-disciplinary approach and diversity in expertise needed to further advance our understanding of high throughput biology.\n\nEvery day I use [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) and [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/), and on some days I [write R packages](https://lcolladotor.github.io/pkgs/). Occasionally I write [blog posts](http://lcolladotor.github.io/#blog) about them and other tools. I'm a co-founder of the [LIBD rstats club](http://LieberInstitute.github.io/rstatsclub/) and the [CDSB community](https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io) of R and Bioconductor developers in Mexico and Latin America, that we described at the [R Consortium website](https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2020/03/18/cdsb-diversity-and-outreach-hotspot-in-mexico). In the past, I also served on the [Bioconductor Community Advisory Board](http://bioconductor.org/about/community-advisory-board/).\n\nIf you want, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lcolladotor) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/lcolladotor.bsky.social).\n\n#### Teaching Assistants\n\nWe also have three amazing TAs this year:\n\n-   Jiaxin (Jessi) Huang ([jhuan206\\@jh.edu](mailto:jhuan206@jh.edu)): I am a second-year master student in the Biostatistics program, specializing in longitudinal data analysis. My current research focuses on exploring and identifying factors associated with long asymptomatic malaria infections. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, cooking, outdoor activities and watching shows.\n-   Phyllis Wei ([ywei43\\@jhu.edu](mailto:ywei43@jhu.edu)). She is a fourth year Ph.D. student in Biostatistics. She develops methods to help understand the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases and enhance disease risk prediction models through data integration. Outside of biostatistics, she enjoys hiking, baking, and visiting museums.\n-   Yu Lu ([ylu136\\@jh.edu](mailto:ylu136@jh.edu)): I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Biostatistics. My work is focused on developing functional data analysis methods inspired by physical activity data. In my free time, I enjoy the outdoor but also cuddling with my cat, Finland. (Didn‚Äôt manage to make him wear a harness and take a walk outside yet)\n\n### Assignment Due Dates\n\nAll course assignment due dates appear on the **Schedule** and **Syllabus**.\n\n### Grading\n\n#### Philosophy\n\nWe believe the purpose of graduate education is to train you to be able to think for yourself and initiate and complete your own projects. We are super excited to talk to you about ideas, work out solutions with you, and help you to figure out how to produce professional data analyses. We do not think that graduate school grades are important for this purpose. This means that we do not care very much about graduate student grades.\n\nThat being said, we have to give you a grade so they will be:\n\n-   A - Excellent - 90%+\n-   B - Passing - 80%+\n-   C - Needs improvement - 70%+\n\nWe rarely give out grades below a C and if you consistently submit work, and do your best you are very likely to get an A or a B in the course.\n\nWhen I was a JHBSPH student in 2011-2016, I had a scholarship from my country üá≤üáΩ which had specific grade requirements, so I recognize that while most employers won't care about your grades over your grad school projects, you might have strong reasons for aiming for high grades.\n\n#### Relative weights\n\nThe grades are based on three projects (plus one entirely optional project to help you get set up). The breakdown of grading will be\n\n-   33% for Project 1\n-   33% for Project 2\n-   34% for Project 3\n\nIf you submit an project solution, it is your own work, and it meets a basic level of completeness and effort you will get 100% for that project. If you submit a project solution, but it doesn't meet basic completeness and effort you will receive 50%. If you do not submit an solution you will receive 0%.\n\n### Submitting assignments\n\nPlease write up your project solutions using R Markdown. In some cases, you will compile a R Markdown file into an HTML file and submit your HTML file to the dropbox on Courseplus. In other cases, you may create an R package or website. In all of the above, when applicable, show all your code and provide as much explanation / documentation as you can.\n\nFor each project, we will provide a time when we download the materials. We will assume whatever version we download at that time is what you are turning in.\n\n### Reproducibility\n\nWe will talk about reproducibility a bit during class, and it will be a part of the homework assignments as well. Reproducibility of scientific code is very challenging, so the faculty and TAs completely understand difficulties that arise. But we think that it is important that you practice reproducible research. In particular, your project assignments should perform the tasks that you are asked to do and create the figures and tables you are asked to make as a part of the compilation of your document. We will have some pointers for some issues that have come up as we announce the projects.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nWe are committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political beliefs/leanings, or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of course participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any work event, including group meetings, conferences, talks, parties, Twitter, and other online media. This code of conduct applies to all course participants, including instructors and TAs, and applies to all modes of interaction, both in-person and online, including GitHub project repos, Slack channels, and Twitter.\n\nI was also part of the Bioconductor Code of Conduct committee for a few years. You might find the Bioconductor Code of Conduct useful as it is translated into different languages by native speakers of said languages: <https://bioconductor.github.io/bioc_coc_multilingual/>.\n\nCourse participants violating these rules will be referred to leadership of the Department of Biostatistics and the Title IX coordinator at JHU and may face expulsion from the class.\n\nAll class participants agree to:\n\n-   **Be considerate** in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of other members.\n-   **Be respectful**. Disagreements happen, but do not require poor behavior or poor manners. Frustration is inevitable, but it should never turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Course participants should be respectful both of the other course participants and those outside the course.\n-   **Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech**. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; and unwelcome sexual attention. If you feel that someone has harassed you or otherwise treated you inappropriately, please alert Stephanie Hicks.\n-   **Take care of each other**. Refrain from advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior. And, if someone asks you to stop, then stop. Alert Stephanie Hicks if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.\n\n### Need Help?\n\nPlease speak with Leonardo Collado Torres or one of the TAs. You can also reach out to Elizabeth Stuart, chair of the department of Biostatistics or Margaret Taub, Ombudsman for the Department of Biostatistics.\n\nYou may also reach out to any Hopkins resource for sexual harassment, discrimination, or misconduct:\n\n-   JHU Sexual Assault Helpline, 410-516-7333 (confidential)\n-   [University Sexual Assault Response and Prevention website](http://sexualassault.jhu.edu/?utm_source=JHU+Broadcast+Messages+-+Synced+List&utm_campaign=c9030551f7-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_12_11&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_af6859b027-c9030551f7-69248741)\n-   [Johns Hopkins Compliance Hotline](https://johnshopkinsspeak2us.tnwreports.com/?utm_source=JHU+Broadcast+Messages+-+Synced+List&utm_campaign=c9030551f7-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_12_11&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_af6859b027-c9030551f7-69248741), 844-SPEAK2US (844-733-2528)\n-   [Hopkins Policies Online](https://jhu.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bd75ef1a5cad0cbfd522412c4&id=8a667a12dd&e=b1124f7c17)\n-   [JHU Office of Institutional Equity](https://jhu.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bd75ef1a5cad0cbfd522412c4&id=928bcfb8a9&e=b1124f7c17) 410-516-8075 (nonconfidential)\n-   [Johns Hopkins Student Assistance Program](https://jhu.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bd75ef1a5cad0cbfd522412c4&id=98f4091f97&e=b1124f7c17) (JHSAP), 443-287-7000\n-   [University Health Services](https://jhu.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bd75ef1a5cad0cbfd522412c4&id=d51077694c&e=b1124f7c17), 410-955-1892\n-   [The Faculty and Staff Assistance Program](https://jhu.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bd75ef1a5cad0cbfd522412c4&id=af1f20bd97&e=b1124f7c17) (FASAP), 443-997-7000\n\n### Feedback\n\nWe welcome feedback on this Code of Conduct.\n\n### License and attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is distributed under a Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license.
